## Requirements
MATLAB R2024b was used for generating the figures in the publication, but older versions should also work.
### Other toolboxes needed
* Bioinformatics toolbox

### Other packages needed
* BioinformaticsAEB, My library for bioinformatics-related functions, [GitHub](https://github.com/aebergl/BioinformaticsAEB)
* MatSurv, Survival analysis in MATLAB, [GitHub](https://github.com/aebergl/MatSurv)
* DensScat, A fast MATLAB function for creating density scatter plots for large datasets, [GitHub](https://github.com/aebergl/DensScat)
* AEB_COLOR, Color-related functions, including color palettes, [GitHub](https://github.com/aebergl/AEB_COLOR)

## Initiation ##

### MRA_Options.m ###
Script defining the base directory and folder structure. Also allows for linking to already downloaded molecular data files.

**Please edit the 'Opt.BaseDir' to your folder of choice**

### InitiateMRA.m ##
Function for initiating the folder structure and checking that all functions are available for the â€œA dysregulated methylome modulates the radiosensitivity of cancer" article.

## Downloading and Processing Files ##

### DownloadProcessTCGAPanCanM450.m ###
This is a function for downloading and processing Illumina M450K Pancancer data for the article "A dysregulated methylome modulates the radiosensitivity of cancer. "The function will also download additional annotation files used in the article. It is recommended that the large "jhu-usc.edu_PANCAN_HumanMethylation450.betaValue_whitelisted.tsv" file is downloaded separately, as using "websave" takes significant time. The location of the files can be given in the MRA_Options.m files or can be directly put in the "/RawDataDir" folder.

Additional annotation files will also be downloaded and placed in the "/SampleAnnotation" folder. These files can also be found in the [SampleAnnotation folder.](/SampleAnnotation)
